== Remove an unwanted commit

To remove unwanted commit(s), for example, if you have accidentally added a bad commit, you can remove by squashing, and dropping the bad commit, for example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git rebase -i HEAD~2
----

Change pick to drop in the commit message on the wrong commit and then:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git push origin <feature_branch> --force
----

== What files changed in last x commits?

For example, the last three commits:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git diff --name-only HEAD HEAD~3
----

[source,terminal]
----
modules/olm-catalogsource.adoc
modules/olm-creating-fb-catalog-image.adoc
modules/olm-mirroring-catalog-airgapped.adoc
modules/olm-mirroring-catalog-colocated.adoc
modules/rosa-sts-setting-up-environment.adoc
modules/virt-configuring-masquerade-mode-dual-stack.adoc
----

== Restore a file to latest merged version

[source,terminal]
----
$ git checkout main -- installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc
----

== Renaming files

You can `git mv` a file from an old name to a new name.

Use:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git mv <source> <destination>
----

[NOTE]
====
If you don't use `git mv`, Git tries to auto-detect renames or moves on `git add` or `git commit`. If a file is deleted and a new file is created, and those files have a majority of lines in common, Git will automatically detect that the file was moved. `git mv` isnâ€™t required.
====

== Delete the most recent commit without destroying the work

[source,terminal]
----
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
----

== Delete the most recent commit and remove the changes

[source,terminal]
----
$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
----

== I've got a bad feeling about this

Check what HEAD is set to in the current branch:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat .git/HEAD
----

The HEAD should match the current branch name, for example:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ref: refs/heads/my-example-branch
----

[NOTE]
====
For the `main` feature branch, you should see `refs/heads/main`.
====

== Oh no! I've totally ruined my feature branch and I want to return it to pristine condition before any commits

Reset hard and then push:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git reset --hard upstream/main
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ git-push-force
----

For a branch based on (for example), enterprise-4.10:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git reset --hard upstream/enterprise-4.10
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ git-push-force
----

== Oh no! I've pushed an incorrect commit to a PR by mistake!

Get the commit ID for the bad commit from `git log` and revert the commit, then push your changes. A new revert commit is added to the PR.

[source,terminal]
----
$ git-log-branch
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ git revert 16bf19550b9f49bceec7fda7f765040357e0bcaf
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ git push
----

== Oh no! I want to reset to the last good commit on my local branch

Reset to last good commit:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git-log-branch
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ git reset 16bf19550b9f49bceec7fda7f765040357e0bcaf
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ git add .
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ git commit -m "reseting to last good commit"
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ git-push-force
----

=== Oh no! I need to recover from an unsuccessful git rebase

Do the below to undo a completed rebase:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git reflog
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
$ git reflog
222967b (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{0}: rebase (finish): returning to refs/heads/main
222967b (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{1}: rebase (squash): My big rebase
c388f0c HEAD@{2}: rebase (squash): # This is a combination of 20 commits
56ee04d HEAD@{3}: rebase (start): checkout HEAD~20
0a0f875 HEAD@{4}: commit: An old good commit
[...]
----

Find the commit just before the incorrect rebase, e.g., `HEAD@{4}`, then:

[source,terminal]
----
git checkout HEAD@{4}
----

== Oh no! I messed up and committed + pushed to a branch that I should have forked from

Force a change to the server with the last good commit, for example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git push -f origin 17c44cc:enterprise-4.6
----

Then force local on the same commit:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git reset --hard 17c44cc
----

== Creating a new PR on a new branch from a single commit on another branch

*Scenario* You have merged a PR to main, and you also want to make those changes on enterprise-4.9, and for whatever reason, the cherrypick to enterprise-4.9 fails on the original PR. To get the work into enterprise-4.9, you need to create a new PR from a fork of the enterprise-4.9 branch, and cherry-pick the original PR changes, fix the rebase issues, then create a new PR against the enterprise-4.9 branch.

. Get the commit # of the PR that was merged to main, eg., `2d7a94bdce00bb5497576f7cbbc65b59b5c1fe82`

. Checkout enterprise-4.9, and create a new fork from this branch. Make sure and rebase against upstream/enterprise-4.9, and fetch it to local.

. Do the cherry-pick:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git cherry-pick 2d7a94bdce00bb5497576f7cbbc65b59b5c1fe82 -m 1
----

. Rebase and merge/correct any changes. Complete the merge.

. Push --force your changes.

. Create a new PR.

= Creating a global .gitignore file

Create `~/.gitignore`, and add some text, for example:

[source,terminal]
----
/home/aireilly/openshift-docs/openshift-docs.sublime-workspace
/home/aireilly/openshift-docs/openshift-docs.sublime-project
----

Then update your git config to use this global `.gitignore`:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git config --local -e
----

This should bring you into VIM mode looking at your local git config. Just make sure to add the excludesfile line under the [core] section and save it.

[source,terminal]
----
  [core]
      ... (existing configurations)
      excludesfile = /home/aireilly/.gitignore

  [remote "origin"]
      ... (existing configurations)

  [branch "main"]
      ... (existing configurations)
----

Then run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
----

That's it!

You may also need to do

[source,terminal]
----
$ git rm -r --cached .
----

and then

[source,terminal]
----
$ git add .
----

Your ignore unwanted files are then registered as "new". then just unstage the changes to the ignored files. Done!
